# CssFramework
Im creating my very first framework at least im trying to. You can try it yourself but be carefull cause there are probably gonna be lots of bugs


# How do i use it?

You need to install the css file: /css framework/fm-main.css
Some extra functions also need the javascript file so just add it just to be safe: /JS framework/fm-main.js

1. Then go to my website which is also in the folder /HTML_CSS-Examples/index.htm
2. That website is fully made with the framework so you see how it can look.
3. Go to components there you see snippets of all different components and you can copy and paste them.
